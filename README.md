# Network-Simulation
In this project, we explore the interaction between people's preferences or opinions and the strength of their social connections. The basic idea is that social dynamics are driven by two factors:*
- People prefer forming social relationships with other who share their preferences, opinions or interests. 
- People's preferences, opinions or interests tend to become similar to those of other people in their social circle. 

We model these two processes on a small- world network to see how both opinions and relationships change over time.
